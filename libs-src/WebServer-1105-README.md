Couchbase-lite android depends on the [Tiny Java Web Server and Servlet Container](http://tjws.sourceforge.net/).

We are using release 1.105. The source distribution has been checked into this repo in case it ever disappears from the internet.

TJWS is being actively maintained and we will check for updates. However if there is an update that you could use then open an issue.
